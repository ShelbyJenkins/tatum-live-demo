1. native request/response vs. sdk request/response in basic-rpc
    making native request
    parsing native response
    vs
    sdk request
    

2. switching chains
    eth_blocknumber 
        native request
        native response
    ???eth_blocknumber
        native request
        native response
    sdk 
        eth_blocknumber
        ???eth_blocknumber

3. A single data-api request

-
3. latency and reliablity
    code for retries with exponential backoff for native
    code for switching between health checks
    sdk demo
        with five endpoints and you can remove?
        can we get latency testing results?

4. open rpc
    demo
        evm chain picker
        get eth_blocknumber
        input your own rpc
